# nustar_moving_target_notebooks

## Overview:

This repository contains worked examples of how to use the
[nustar_planning](https://github.com/NuSTAR/nustar_moving_target) python library
to plan _NuSTAR_ observations of targets that move in the sky.

To use any of these notebooks requires the installation of the above library and its
requirements. Please see the README file in that repo for more information.

As of now, this repository runs only as Jupyter notebooks. 

The orbit_engine sub-directory contains scripts that (for now) have to be run on one of
the *nix machines at the _NuSTAR_ SOC. If you have observations that you're like to run
that are not currently included, please open an issue request.

This repo will not contain example code for converting the data to heliocentric (or
comparable) coordinates. This is purely to track the *planning* of _NuSTAR_ observations.
